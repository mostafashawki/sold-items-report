# Sales Report example using React

This is a sample React application that demonstrates the implementation of a DataTable component (without any third party libray so it 100% React, Javascript and css) to display data and usage of dark theme using CSS variables. The app allows users to toggle between a light and dark theme and dynamically filter and display data in a table and collapse/expand columns and rows using CSS transitions.

## Features

- Dark theme toggle button with sun ðŸŒž and moon ðŸŒš icons.
- DataTable component to display data in a tabular format.
- Filter functionality to dynamically search and display filtered data using `Show Orders by Countries` button.
- Smooth transitions when collapse/expand columns and rows using CSS transitions, exapnding column by clicking on the `Total Value` header to see the divided amout by brand, and to expand row by clicking on the value itself on each row to see all the orders history items.
- Use `handleRetrieveAllData` function to retrieve all data.
- `Loading` effect on retreiving data and `Debounce` effect on filteration.
